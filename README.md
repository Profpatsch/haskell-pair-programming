## Rules

0. Tell everyone about the club.
1. Join chat XXX. You will obtain collaborator rights to edit this file.
2. Add short contact info into a summary table and verbose info as a separate
   section below. Keep alphabetical order.
3. There are two chats for find partners:
   + the quick one :: to find a partner withing 30 minutes time window
   + the other one :: to find someone for a longer partnership or for general
                      discussions.
4. Nicknames in chat rooms and in this list should match.

1. Availability

   UTC+10 VLAT 9am - 12pm

   I have a very flexible schedule and generally, I am available at any time
   during my day. From time to time I have activities which can't be rescheduled
   but most of the time it's easy for me to be available. But due to my time
   zone, it can be hard to connect with people from Europe or America.
   Australia, Japan, China, and India are much easier.

2. Haskell level of experience

   I am a (advanced?) beginner haskeller who is trying to pass "mythical middle
   level" which every Haskell programmer somehow passes without speaking much
   about it :) Before that, I've been programming with different popular
   languages including C++ and Java.

   I am quite comfortable with basic everyday constructs (i.e. Monoid .. Monad,
   typeclasses, ADT, basic lenses, basics of streaming libraries and I had
   several chances to apply profiling tools). I didn't touch type-level
   programming (including GADT).

3. Interests

   Anything goes. As long as it's Haskell, I'm in :)

   But I don't have experience with pair programming. I mean at my previous job
   we did short "uni-directional" sessions when you come to help a newbie, or
   you are a newbie and someone helps you. But we were never meant to actually
   develop stuff together.

   Also, I have thoughts about tasks planning and knowledge organizing using
   plain text files (emacs ord-mode, etc...). So if someone wants to start a
   small silly project, or want to work with existing tools, that will be
   interesting for me.

1. Availability 

   Time is quite flexible for me. E.g. even now for the next few hours I could
   start and try a session with one of you. I live in UTC+2, CEST, but that
   doesn't mean much because my sleep cycle is often shifted. Even now the local
   time here is 4:43 AM. I suspect your schedule might be a narrower bottleneck
   here.

2. Haskell level of experience

   I've started learning Haskell about 5 years ago IIRC, and about 3 years ago
   I've made it one of my primary languages. I've written a few webservers with
   yesod, a few GUIs with reflex-frp/reflex-dom, and written a few open source
   libraries as well like https://hackage.haskell.org/package/hs-di and
   https://hackage.haskell.org/package/dump

3. Interests

   Two main interests jump to mind at first that I'd quite like to pair on:
   + I'd like to spend a bit of time trying to write a POC solution to this
     issue that I've had with reflex-dom:
     https://github.com/reflex-frp/reflex-dom/issues/175 I have an idea how we
     could begin, but so far I've found it a bit daunting to start working on it
     without a pair.
   + I'd like to find a solution together with someone to this issue with hs-di:
     https://gist.github.com/Wizek/396b0a608fa93d7d458a78dbf7c88870 Maybe with
     someone who has a deeper understanding than I currently possess about GHC
     and similar type errors.
